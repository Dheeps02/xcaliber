---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dheeps02/xcaliber.git
cd xcaliber
npm install && cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
npm run dev
```

No ECU on hand? Run the bundled mock slave and point the connection at `127.0.0.1:5555` — see [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started).

## Built For

- **Calibration engineers** tuning live during bench/dyno sessions
- **Test automation** — script connect, DAQ, and disconnect from CI via the [REST API](/reference/rest-api)
- **Reverse-engineering** unknown ECUs with full packet trace and memory browsing

[Read the use cases →](/guide/use-cases)
